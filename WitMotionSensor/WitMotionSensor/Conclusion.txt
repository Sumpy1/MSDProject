Witmotion Sensor was not suitable for our project, since its usage was very minimal apart fom the application which it had provided just for the Windows interface was not appropriate for our Linux based microcomputer.Also, there were a lot of bugs in its 
API where we couldnot fetch data via the polling interface. Even though data was being exported through callback function, data had no timestamps. Because of all this we discarded the witmotion sensor from project.
We used 'WitMotion HWT905-TTL' Sensor and the API is referenced here: https://witmotion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
